# MediaHoster AndroidTv App

An Android TV app for my <a href="https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/MediaHoster">MediaHoster</a>. This app is specifically implemented to help my Android TV device connect to my server for media streaming. My device is **Honor MediaQ M321**, so I can only assure you that this app is working perfectly fine on this particular thing. Since the **Honor MediaQ M321** is a very old device, the supported minimum API level is 19, which is Android 4.4.

## DEMO

Note: This demo is recorded remotely using ADB CLI, the video played could not be recorded. This app is in English, and it only works with the <a href="https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/MediaHoster">MediaHoster</a>.
